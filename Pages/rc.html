            As a child, Mythbusters was my favorite show. It makes sense that when looking for motivation for a project, I go back to what started it all, Mythbusters season 1 episode 1. In that episode, Adam and Jamie attach multiple rockets to the roof of a car. I went to amazing savings and bought a cheap remote control car and taped a rocket engine to the roof of it. Then came the first problem. I needed to figure out a way to ignite the engine remotely. I wanted to ignite the engine with the same transmitter that I use to control the car. The issue with this is that the transmitter doesn’t have any free buttons or switches. I decided to remove the ability to go in reverse and switch it with the ability to ignite the engine. I cracked open the car and probed the mainboard with a multimeter to find a trace that received power when the car was in reverse. I found one and wired the igniter to that trace. I had mixed results. While the engine lit off, it spun out of control. To combat this, I 3D designed and printed a set of fins that will not only keep the car driving straight but also keep its wheels on the ground. This modification worked beautifully and the car drove way more straight. While it’s not perfect, I am working on improving it daily and soon enough it will work perfectly every time.
