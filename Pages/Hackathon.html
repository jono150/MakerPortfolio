        <p>The handy helper was my submission for a hackathon competition. The event was sponsored by the Jewish Home Family, a senior center, and therefore we were tasked with creating a device that will give elderly people more independence. While most teams made some sort of smart pill dispenser, we went the creative route and made a bracelet that lets a nurse monitor them from a distance. This gives them a feeling of independence while the nurses are still able to monitor them. The device utilizes a Node MCU which is a microprocessor that can connect to the internet to send data from the bracelet to the nurse’s computers. The device also has a button so that they can use to call for the nurse, a speaker so that the nurse can give them a message and speak with them, an accelerometer to detect if they fall, and a heart rate sensor to detect the person’s heart rate and alert the nurses immediately if its too high or too low. We won the competition and returned home with a dual sense of accomplishment, winning the competition, and thinking creatively while building something to better the lives of the elderly.
