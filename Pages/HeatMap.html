            Recently, I met a colleague of my grandfather who is a physician. In our conversation, he mentioned that he was dealing with the effects of severe color vision deficiency. When I asked him how it impacted his work, he told me that he is unable to read colored heat maps. I viewed his struggle as a personal challenge and set out to help. I built software that could translate and display the data clearly using non-colored graphics. Once that problem was solved, I expanded the scope of the software to be able to take any image and show the colors and contrasts in a way that was friendly for those with color vision deficiency. This turned out to be one of the most difficult projects for me because I too am color blind and so I had the additional challenge of programming a machine without the visual cues available to others - in some ways like flying a plane by only using the instruments and not seeing out the window. This additional challenge gave me so much satisfaction, in part because the purpose of my work impacted me as well.
