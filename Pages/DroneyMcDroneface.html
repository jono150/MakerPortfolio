            For this project, there was no profound motivation or eureka moment. This project started when one of my friends was telling me about the drone that he had just bought, and I said to myself, “I could build a drone,” so that’s exactly what I did. The first problem I ran into was price. It turns out, building a drone is a pretty expensive task, and while I thought I had calculated all the costs, I was hit from behind with some secret costs. I went online and found all the cheapest components that I could. This was a huge gamble because if these parts were no good, I would have lost a lot of money. Thankfully the parts were good, and I was able to complete the drone. That’s when I ran into the second problem. The second problem that I faced was that I had no idea how to fly a drone, and I kept crashing. I wanted to get a simulator for my computer so I could practice without risking my drone, but my computer wasn’t fast enough to run it. Finally, I decided, the only way to learn is to practice, so I took my drone, got it up in the air, and then crashed it. This happened over and over again. Luckily, I built my drone tough, and after many many crashes, I got to be a pretty good pilot. This drone project has given me many hours of fun.
